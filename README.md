An Epitech innovative project owned and created by Students since their third years.

To start the project simply install first nodejs on your computer, then check if you got the npm installer. If so, npm start. It will create a folder with all the librairies required for this project, to see which packages are download, go to package.json and bower.json. 

The script will create a localhost using the 8000 port. 

You could notice that in the depo you have a test folder, you can create your own test and test it using npm test.
